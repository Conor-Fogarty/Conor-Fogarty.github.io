            <p >
                <h4 class = 'pmod'>User Profile Management System:</h4> <p class = 'pmod'>Orchestrated the development of a robust framework facilitating the creation and administration of user profiles, each distinguished by unique identification numbers. Ensured the integrity and security of the user database, fostering a structured and protected environment for sensitive information</p>.

                <h4 class = 'pmod'>Efficient Data Handling:</h4> <p class = 'pmod'>Engineered functionalities to optimize the storage and retrieval of user-specific data, enhancing the efficiency of data manipulation and access operations. Streamlined processes for storing and accessing information, promoting seamless interaction with user data.</p>
                
                <h4 class = 'pmod'>Access Control Architecture:</h4> <p class = 'pmod'>Implemented a sophisticated access hierarchy system accommodating diverse user roles, including Professors, Teaching Assistants (TAs), Administrators, and Students. Structured access levels tailored to each user role, ensuring appropriate permissions and privileges within the system.</p>
                
                <h4 class = 'pmod'>Role-Based Capabilities:</h4> <p class = 'pmod'>Empowered users with elevated access levels—such as Professors, TAs, and Administrators—with comprehensive functionalities to manage and modify data within the platform. Facilitated collaboration and accuracy by enabling higher-level users to add, edit, and update information within the gradebook.</p>
                
                <h4 class = 'pmod'>Transparency and Accessibility:</h4> <p class = 'pmod'>Provided lower-level access users, including Students, with the ability to view essential information, fostering transparency and accessibility across the system. Promoted inclusivity and ease of access to pertinent data for all user categories.</p></p>

            <h3 class = 'pmod'> Process Explanation</h3>
            <p class = 'pmod'> This project is very dear to my heart, it was the capstone project for my first programming course ever, and looking back there are so many things I would like to switch and build different looking back with two years and significantly more object orientated programming and DSA understanding behind me, espically memory access and modification and cypography for the control architecture however it is great to go back and look at how far I've come. Thank you for your interest! </p>
